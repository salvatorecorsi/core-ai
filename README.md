Core AI is a plug-and-play WordPress module that simplifies AI service integration  in your plugins. It offers centralized API key management (OpenAI/Anthropic), detailed  call logging, usage statistics, and a ready-to-use admin interface that each plugin  can integrate wherever preferred: as main menu, submenu, or in WordPress settings.
